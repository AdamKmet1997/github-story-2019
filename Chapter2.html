  <h1> Spring Season </h1>
<p>Spring period began and our team got back together after long period of rest mainly caused by bad weather which<br>
caused teams not being able to play their matches because the grass was simply way too soft for a football match.<br>
Players are eager to get back to play, with new additions to the team the confidence is growing amongs the players.<br>
Our team can look forward to quarter finale in next 2 weeks which is always hard mentally and physically,<br>
because as well all know cup matches are always more demanding due to the nature of the matches. In our case our match <br>
will face oposition that is league above which means that they wont be able to gather much information about the playing style <br>
of the oposition. the 2 qurter finals will follow by 2 matches in the league against oposition that in the second place in the league.<br>
Coaches have been preparing our team tactically for the matches ahead and players have been very happy with the work that has been done.<br>
Heading into first quorter finale our team will play away which means long travel. Some people think this is advantage because it allows <br>
players to prepare mentally together. <br>
As the match start our team looks very confident and not even thinking about being careful since they are facing more <br>
experienced oposition. This mentality pays off and we go 1 nill up just after 10 minutes. This goal is causing the match speed to pick up <br>
which means better prepared team will benefit from this. As we mentioned above out team has been working hard in preparation for this mathc <br>
and end up scoring second goal just before half time whistle goes off.<br>
Heading into the second half the oposition comes out flying and end up having some very good chances but sharp saves from our Goalkeeper <br>
keeps us in the lead. After first 20 minutes of second half we score third goal from penalty and from now on all we have to care about,<br>
is staying away from injuries and managing the game.The oposition is startign to realising that they have no chance and end up conceeding <br>
last goal to make it 4:0 whci is placing our team in the semifinale of the Cup.<br>
In next chapter we will follow out team in their journey into the finale which will bring us close to see how far we can get and if  we <br>
have a chance in winning the cup.
