  <h1> Spring Season </h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Spring period began and our team got back together after long period of rest mainly caused by bad weather which<br>
caused teams not being able to play their matches because the grass was simply way too soft for a football match.<br>
Players are eager to get back to play, with new additions to the team the confidence is growing amongs the players.<br>
Our team can look forward to 2 quarter finals in next 2 weeks which is always hard mentally and physically,<br>
because as well all know cup matches are always more demanding due to the nature of the matches. In our case our match <br>
will face oposition that is league above which means that they wont be able to gather much information about the playing style <br>
of the oposition. the 2 qurter finals will follow by 2 matches in the league against oposition that in the second place in the league.<br>
Coaches have been preparing our team tactically for the matches ahead and players have been very happy with the work that has been done.<br>
Heading into first quorter finale our team will play away which means long travel. Some people think this is advantage because it allows <br>
players to prepare mentally together.
