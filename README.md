# github-story-2019
# Spring

## Idea
My idea is based on Spring part of the season in football. I have decided to go this direction because
I'm passionate about football and actually this story is based on real situations that have happened to me.
Found it easier and more natural to talk about my life than making up story.

## Structure
The " Book" contains home page that's acting as  a introduction to the story. Followed by 3 chapters that are telling the story and
incase you don't like the ending there is a finale chapter called alternative ending.
