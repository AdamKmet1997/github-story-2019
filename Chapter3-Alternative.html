  Our team is finally in the finale. The training that we have done over the weeeks and the preperation that has been <br>
   done for this match will hopefull pay off.
  With home advantage we will be hoping to win the title and make history by doing so.<br>
   When the referee of the match blows the whistle our team out of nowhere
  starts looking very confused and nervouse. Almost as if they are scared of the oposition.<br>
   This is not a good sign especially when we know thta our
  opposition is better than we are and every bit of confidence on our side will be helpful.<br>
   The nervousness eventually results in our oposition scoring 2 goals in 10 minutes and
  ends up leading the match 2 : 0 at the half time. Our manager is doing his best in the dressing room trying to wake his team up and to help them<br>

  to win this match but nothing seems to be working. When our players return to the pitch there is no sign of any improvement at all.
  Our opposition can see this and starts applying pressure on our team.<br>
    This pressure eveentuyally leads to another goal just 15 minutes before the mathc
  is officially over.

  Our team never managed to pick them self up and ended up loosing the finaly 3:0 which means all the hard work meant nothing becaue we just simply got
  scared of the oposition and never really got into the game.<br>

    what followed next was just deppressing time in the dressing room. No one said anything we just sat in our spots with our heads down.<br> Manager was
    only able to say one sentence due to his dissapointment. " Next year we will have the experience that we were missing tonight, Heads Up !!!"
