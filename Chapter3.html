      <p>The big day has come. The day of the Semi finale where our team will face their biggest rivals.<br>
         The only team that can mathc their
      skills and the only team that can last running with us for the whole length of the match.<br>
      No one expected our team to get this far in the cup but we have done it. To be honest our goal before the season wasnt<br>
      to get this far eaither as mainly we have been concentrating on leaguea matches in order to get promoted but<br>
      becuase of our form in recent months we are here now and  we will fight.<br>
      The day begins as usual. Home match, music blasting from the dressng room, managers are giving their last tactical informations.<br>
      When the match begins , the oposition comes out flying. Not allowing our team to do anything that they planned to do in first 15 minutes <br>
      of the match.
       After initial 20 minutes of the match our team begins to look much sharper and gets the majority of the possesion<br>
        back on their feet.
      With our first shot of the game we manage to score a beautiful goal right into the top corner of the oposition goal.<br>
      Home fans are going mad with celebrations and so are our players. Everyones happy. for the next 15 minutes our team<br>
       manages to retain the lead and goes into the dressign room
      with 1 goal to nothing lead.<br>
      In the second half our players look fresh and with new tactics in mind we manage to score <br>
      yet another goal that puts us in 2 goal lead.
      The next 20 minutes will be hard. Oposition is applying pressure on our defenders <br>
       and with only 5 minitues to go we conceed a goal to make the score 2:1
      Lucky for us the rest of the managee our players managed to defend well and wond the match 2:1<br>
       which means we are off to the Finale of the tournament.
      Everyones celebrating as if we  have already won the tournament adn they deserve it.
      <br>
      <br>
      When the day of the finale comes our players are ready. More than ready.<br>
      Fresh tactics made just with one purpose - beat the oposition.<br>
      Referee blows the whistle and match begins. Our team is facing easier oponent that they were in semi finale but theres a<br>
      reason why is this team in the finale. First 20 minutes our team is on top and manages to score 1 goal. Everythings<br>
      goin as planed and before second half comes we manage to score one more goal to make it 2:0 heading into the half time.<br>
      In the second half the oposition scores and it might seem as if the early goal wakes them up. for the next 10 minutes the<br>
      oposition will have 3 goal chances but luck was on our side this time . Heading into finale 15 minutes our team managed<br>
      to gain possesion of the ball and end up coring one last time before the mathc is over.<br>
      Unbelievalble has happened. Team that was lowest ranked out of last 8 teams that were remaining the cup has won the<br>
      whole turnament. Celebrations begin and you can be sure of the fact that they wont end until<br>
      the weekend is over. The history has been made that day and Club is very proud of the boys that Fought hard to<br>
      reach this milestone. </p>
