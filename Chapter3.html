<p>The big day has come. The day of the Semi finale where our team will face their biggest rivals. The only team that can mathc their
skills and the only team that can last running with us for the whole length of the match.
No one expected our team to get this far in the cup but we have done it. To be honest our goal before the season wasnt
to get this far eaither as mainly we have been concentrating on leaguea matches in order to get promoted but
becuase of our form in recent months we are here now and  we will fight.
The day begins as usual. Home match, music blasting from the dressng room, managers are giving their last tactical informations.
When the match begins , the oposition comes out flying. Not allowing our team to do anything that they planned to do in first 15 minutes of the match.
 After initial 20 minutes of the match our team begins to look much sharper and gets the majority of the posetion back on their feet.
With our first shot of the game we manage to score a beautiful goal right into the top corner of the oposition goal.
Home fans are going mad with celebrations and so are our players. Everyones happy. for the next 15 minutes our team manages to retain the lead and goes into the dressign room
with 1 goal to nothing lead.
In the second half our players look fresh and with new tactics in mind we manage to score yet another goal that puts us in 2 goal lead.
The next 20 minutes will be hard. Oposition is applying pressure on our defenders  and with only 5 minitues to go we conceed a goal to make the score 2:1
Lucky for us the rest of the managee our players managed to defend well and wond the match 2:1 which means we are off to the Finale of the tournament.
Everyones celebrating as if we  have already won the tournament adn they deserve it. </p>
