        <h1> Spring Season - The Begining </h1>
          <p> Spring. In football world Spring means pressure, nerves, injuries, finals, winners and loosers.<br>
          Spring is a period of the year where past few months of hard work can reward you or brake you.<br>
          It is this time of the year when the football season is finishing up, when Cup Semi-Finales and Finals and happening.<br>
          Many teams and players are at the peak of their form and doing their best to get the most out of the current season<br>
          so they can enjoy their summer holidays with Gold medal hanging on their chest.<br>
          Spring period follows the winter transfer period where some teams lean towards buying new players<br>
          in order to strenghten the squad that they currently have.This can be caused by players getting injured,<br>
          losing their form or getting attracted by other teams which means teams end up missing player on their position. </p>
